riverpod has multiple providers with each provider providing something

Widget ref is an objects that lets widgets communicate/interact with the providers

1. provider -> read only can provide classes widgest etc
provider ref allows us to talk with other providers
in order to access the provider we can use consumer widget
and in consumerwidget we have to use widget ref that is used to contact with other providers refs 	

there are two types of reading 
using consumer widget or consumerstateful widget
using stateless and builder Consumer

ref.watch -> read continuously
ref.read -> read once
we can use select with watch when we want to update the widget incase of single property update 

consumer builder can be used if we only some part of the widget is dependent on the data on that we can use only consumer
because upon reciving a change the widget will be rebuild in case of consumer widget whole scaffold is rebuild


2. stateprovider is used to update the value that we cant perfrom in normal provider so it is an upgrade
by default all the providers are immutable so here in case of stateprovider we can directly change the value but with the help of the
notifier method we can do it with using update
it is used for simple values like int double etc 

3. for complex values(handling classes , maps ) we will be using 3rd type of provider called stateNotifier and statenotifier provider

4.change notifier provider(should not be use much)

5.Future Provider 
provider based on http codes or Future values like eg firebase data , better and shorter code for future builder

6.streamProvider
